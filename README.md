I am taking this course from Udemy "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu the Lead Instructor at the London App Brewery. I have had the course for over a year and when I first started I only reached Day 11 and the reason I stop there is because I jumped to another tech stack trying to chase the next coolest thing but I will not see another programming language until I finish this course and the projects that come with it. I will not be following the course up to a certain point day by day, mainly because some things I already know and just going thru as a refresher and others will take time to finish because of my day to day life demands. Anyways Let's Get It.
